This indicates the heavy activity in shared_buffers.<br/>
Loading or removing pages from shared_buffers requires exclusive lock on the page. Each session also can put a shared lock on the page.<br/>
High BufferMapping can indicate that big working-set-of-data by each session which the system is struggling to accomodate.<br/>
Excessive indexes and bloated indexes and unpartitioned huge tables are the common reasons.
