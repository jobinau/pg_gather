<h2>IO:BufFileRead</h2>
BufFileRead happens when temporary files generated for SQL execution are read back to memory.<br>
Generally this happens after BuffileWrite.<br/>
BufFileRead means that PostgreSQL is Reading from buffered Temporary Files.<br/>
All sorts of temporary files including the one used for sort and hashjoins, parallel execution, And files used by single sessions (refer: buffile.c) can be responsible for this.<br/>
Query tuning effort is suggestable.
