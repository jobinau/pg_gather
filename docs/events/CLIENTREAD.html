<h2>Client:ClientRead</h2>
<p>
This event occurs when a PostgreSQL backend process is waiting to receive data or a new command from the connected client application.<br/>
Essentially, the database has finished its previous task and is asking, "What should I do next?"<br/>
</p>
Big precentage of ClientRead indicates that the response from application is not fast enough. It is wasting wall-clock time and potentially holding locks.<br/>
"ClientRead" wait-event combined with "idle-in-transaction" can cause contention in the server. <br/>
Two reasons generally cause high values for this wait-event<br/>
<h3>Why it is happening (Root Causes)</h3>
<h4>1. Network Latency (The "Slow Road"):</h4> 
The communication channel between the database and the application/client may have low bandwith or high latency.<br/>
For example, there could be too many network hops. Many of the Cloud, Virtualization, Containerization, Firewall, and Routing (sometimes multi-layer routing) are found to cause high network latency.<br/>
Latency has nothing to do with network bandwidth. Even a very high bandwidth connection can have high latency and affect the database performance.<br/>
Please remember that the network related waits within the trasactions are generally accounted as "ClientRead"
<h4>2. Application Logic (The "Long Pause"):</h4> 
This is the most dangerous cause. It happens when an application starts a transaction (BEGIN), performs a SQL command, and then pauses to do non-database work<br/>
(like sending an email, processing a file, or calling an external API) before sending the next SQL command or COMMIT.<br/>
During this pause, the database is left waiting for the next command from the application, leading to "ClientRead" waits.<br/>
This situation is particularly problematic because it can lead to long-held locks and increased contention within the database.<br/>
<h4>3. Human Error:</h4>
A user with interactive login access may start a transaction and then get distracted or take a long time to issue the next command or COMMIT.<br/>
