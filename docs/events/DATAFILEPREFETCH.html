<h2>IO:DataFilePrefetch</h2>
<p>DataFilePrefetch indicates:
1. PostgreSQL is performing read-ahead operations to prefetch data blocks from disk into shared buffers before they're actually needed<br/>
2. The system is waiting for these asynchronous I/O operations to finish<br/>
3. It's part of PostgreSQL's optimization to reduce I/O wait times for subsequent queries</p>
<h3> When It Occurs</h3>
DataFilePrefetch typically happens during:<br/>
1. Large sequential scans<br/>
2. Index scans that will need many blocks<br/>
3. Operations where PostgreSQL predicts future block needs<br/>
<h3>Performance Implications</h3>
Some DataFilePrefetch waits are normal and indicate the prefetch system is working,However, Excessive waits might suggest:<br/>
1. Slow storage subsystem<br/>
2. Need to tune shared_buffers or <code>maintenance_work_mem</code><br/>
3. High concurrent I/O load<br/>
