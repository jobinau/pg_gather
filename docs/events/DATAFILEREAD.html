<h2>IO:DataFileRead</h2>
DataFileRead occurs when a connection needs to access a specific data page that is not currently present in the PostgreSQL Shared Buffers. <br/>
The process must wait while the operating system reads the page from the disk (or filesystem cache) into memory.

<h3>Implication:</h3>
While some disk reads are normal, a high percentage of these wait events typically indicates that your active dataset (working set) is larger than your available memory,<br/>
or that inefficient queries are forcing unnecessary disk reads.

<h3>Why it is happening (Root Causes)</h3>
If this event is dominating, look for these culprits:
<ul>
<li>Sequential Scans (Missing Indexes): <br/>
If a query scans a whole table because it lacks an index, it forces PostgreSQL to read old/unused data from the disk churning the cache.<br/>
Missing or inefficient indexes are a common cause of high DataFileRead events.<br>
</li>
<li>Insufficient Memory:<br/>
The shared_buffers (PostgreSQL's cache) or the OS Page Cache (System RAM) is too small to hold the "hot" (frequently accessed) data.
</li>
<li>
Cold Cache:<br/>
This is normal immediately after a database restart because the memory is empty.
</li>
<li>
Bloat:<br/>
If tables/indexes are bloated with dead rows, PostgreSQL has to read more pages from the disk to get the same amount of live data.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comparison: IO:DataFileRead vs. IO:DataFilePrefetch</h3>
It is important not to confuse this with Prefetching.
<ul>
<li>DataFileRead: The process is stuck waiting for a specific page it needs right now.</li>
<li>DataFilePrefetch: The OS is reading pages ahead of time because it anticipates you will need them (an optimization).</li>
</ul>
