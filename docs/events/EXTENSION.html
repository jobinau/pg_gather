<h2>Extension</h2>
<p>The server process is waiting for some condition defined by an extension module <br/>
In other words, The PostgreSQL process is waiting for an operation defined by an installed Extension (add-on module) to complete.<br/>
The core database engine is "handing over the wheel" to an external module.<br/>
If you see high waits here, the bottleneck is not in standard PostgreSQL features (like tables or indexes), but in the specific logic of the extension you are using.
</p>
<h3>Why it is happening (Root Causes)</h3>
Following extensions are some of the common trouble makers that can cause waits in this category:
<ul>
<li>Foreign Data Wrappers (postgres_fdw, oracle_fdw):<br/>
This is the most common cause. If you query a remote table, your local PostgreSQL waits for the remote server to reply.<br/>
While waiting for the network packet, the wait event is often "Extension".
<li>
Distributed Databases (Citus/TimescaleDB):<br/>
If you use Citus, the "Coordinator" node must wait for "Worker" nodes to process data and send it back.<br/>
That wait is often recorded as an Extension event.
</li>
<li>
Logical Replication Plugins:<br/>
Custom logical decoders (used for CDC - Change Data Capture) might wait on external systems to acknowledge data receipt.
</li>
<li>
Background Workers (pg_cron):<br/>
Tools like pg_cron sleep while waiting for the next scheduled job time. This sleep is technically a wait event.
</li>
</ul>
