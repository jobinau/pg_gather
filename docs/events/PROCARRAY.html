<h2>LWLock:ProcArray</h2>
Waiting to access the shared per-process data structures (typically, to get a snapshot or report a session's transaction ID).
This happens when a PostgreSQL process is waiting to access the Process Array, a critical data structure in shared memory that tracks all active backend processes and their transaction IDs.
