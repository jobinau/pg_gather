<h2>Lwlock:SharedTidBitmap</h2>
LWLock that occurs when a backend process is waiting to access or modify a shared TID (Tuple ID) bitmap
after the leader process builds a bitmap of qualifying tuple locations (via a bitmap index scan), it may share this bitmap with parallel workers so they can cooperatively scan the table (heap). 
The SharedTidBitmap lightweight lock ensures safe concurrent access to this shared bitmap structure
