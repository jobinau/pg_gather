<h2>IPC:SyncRep</h2>
<p>This event occurs when a transaction has completed locally and is waiting for confirmation from a remote standby server before it can return "Success" to the client.</p>
PostgreSQL "Synchronous Replication" is technically Asynchronous Replication + A Wait. The database does not "write successfully to both places at the exact same instant." Instead,<br/>
it writes locally, streams the data asynchronously to the standby, and then pauses the user session (generating this wait event) until the standby sends a "Thumbs Up" acknowledgment.

<h3>Why it is happening (Root Causes)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The "Lie" of Sync Replication:<br/>
PostgreSQL does not slow down your INSERT or UPDATE statements while they are running.<br/>
The data transmission to the standby happens in the background (by WAL Senders).<br/>
The IPC:SyncRep wait only kicks in at the very end, during COMMIT. </li>
<li>Network Latency (RTT):<br/>
Since the primary must send a message and receive a reply, the minimum duration of this wait is the Round Trip Time (RTT) between servers.<br/>
If your servers are 50ms apart, every commit will wait at least 50ms.</li>
<li>
Standby Performance Issues:<br/>
If the Standby server is overloaded or has slow disks, it cannot write the WAL data fast enough to send the acknowledgment back.<br/>
The Primary waits in IPC:SyncRep while the Standby struggles to catch up.
