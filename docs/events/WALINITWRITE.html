<h2>IO:WALInitWrite</h2>
When the system needs a new WAL segment and there are no old segments available to recycle, it must create a new one. During this process, PostgreSQL "initializes" the file by filling it with zeros. 
The WALInitWrite event specifically tracks the time spent waiting for the disk write portion of this zero-filling process.
<h3>How to Reduce WALInitWrite Waits</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Increase min_wal_size & max_wal_size: This encourages PostgreSQL to keep more "recycled" WAL files on hand, reducing the need to initialize new ones during peak traffic.</li>
    <li>Check Disk Latency: Ensure your storage subsystem (SSD/NVMe) is performing within expected latency bounds.</li>
    <li>Use a Dedicated WAL Volume: Placing the pg_wal directory on a separate, high-performance physical disk can prevent contention between data file I/O and log I/O.</li>
    <li>Check for "Zero-fill" performance: On some modern storage/filesystems, zero-filling is very fast, but if you are on older hardware or specific cloud storage types, it can become a bottleneck.</li>
</ul>
