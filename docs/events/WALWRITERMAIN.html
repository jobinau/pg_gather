<h2>WalWriterMain</h2>
When you see <code>WalWriterMain</code>, the process is essentially in its "main loop," idling until it is triggered to work again by a timer or by the volume of data reaching a certain threshold.<br/>
Default Sleep Cycles: The process sleeps for <code>wal_writer_delay</code> (default 200ms) before checking if it needs to flush data again.
